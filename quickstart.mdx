## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Joining An Organization>
  To join an organization on Panaptico, simply have a team member invite you on.
  A team member can invite you by heading over to settings in the left menu, in the first tab selecting invite member.
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Putting your name in the input.
    once you receive the email [You should click the link where you will be prompted to sign up for a new Panaptico account, after completing your sign up, you are now a part of the organization].
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
